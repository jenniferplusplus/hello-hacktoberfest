# Archived

I've decided to archive this project because I do not want to maintain it or respond to random unprompted PRs. I'm glad if you've found it useful and you're welcome to work through it on your own.

# hello-hacktoberfest

This is basically a hello world app built with Vue, Vuetify, and RxJS. The purpose of this app is to provide a simple-yet-realistic repository to be used as a practice space for an educational git/github workshop. The names in the initial list are the leadership team of [WWC DFW][carrd] as of September 2020.

# Workshop

The goal of the workshop is to practice the steps of making a fork, clone, commit, and pull request. During the workshop, you will submit a pull request to this repository which adds your name to the list of names in the file at [/src/data/names.json][names.json]. This will add your name to the sequence that is displayed in the hello message on the UI (pictured in the gif above).

If you are new to programming generally, or to Javascript or Vue specifically, I would invite you to examine the application code as well and try to get an idea of how it's working.

You can read my writeup of the talk and follow along with the workshop [on my blog][blog]. There will likely also be a video recording of the talk posted later.

## Steps

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone that fork to your local computer
3. Add your name to the list in the names.json file
4. Commit that change and push it to your remote repository on GitHub
5. Open a pull request from the fork back to the original repository

# Respect the Spirit of the Event

This repository and workshop are here to help you learn how to work on a community project within GitHub. The goal is not to artificially boost your Pull Requests for the purpose of qualifying for Hacktoberfest. Please don't attempt to use the repository that way. See the [official Hacktoberfest guidelines around quality standards][spam] for more info.

# Local Development

You shouldn't need to actually run this application yourself in order to make the change. That said, if you want to play with it, you are more than welcome to do so. You will need to have a reasonably up to date version of node.js installed on your computer. Once that is done, you can open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository. Then run the below commands in your terminal to setup your development environment and run the app.

This app was built with the Vue-CLI. If you've used that tool, then this will be familiar. If you haven't used Vue before, this app is a very basic example of that framework, but you should also review the Vue project's [Getting Started Guide][getting started].

## Project setup

```

### Host the app with development features enabled
```
